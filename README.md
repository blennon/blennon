- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bill Lennon. I'm a entrepreneur, builder, product leader, husband and dad. I fell in love with AI and entrepreneurship at an early age and got my PhD from one of the pioneers of artificial neural networks, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. In 2015, I founded Ground.work and built the first online bank and money management solution for nonprofits. I'm passionate about building teams, products and companies that positively impact the world.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs).
